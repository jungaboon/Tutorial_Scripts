# Tutorial_Scripts
A collection of scripts for my tutorials

Use these scripts as a general guide, but I highly encourage you to look at other resources as well in order to improve your own versions. I'm a learner as well, so things may not be 100% optimal. If there are any improvements you'd like me to make, please let me know.
